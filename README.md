# graph-tool-docs 

## v 2.2.44

HTML docs of the [graph-tool](https://github.com/count0/graph-tool) python library, for offline use.

I had some trouble compiling the docs with Sphinx, so ...

* I spidered the website
* added a local version of MathJax
* added a local version of google webfonts
* fixed links to the logo

## License

graph-tool is GPLv3, and the docs are part of it.
